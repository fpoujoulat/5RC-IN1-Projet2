# Projet 2

## Introduction
This is a small project wrote for the 5RC-IN1 Python Module. It includes various little security tools to generate passwords and passphrases and check their strength.

**DISCLAIMER none of the tools in this suite are likely to be cryptographically secure. Use at your own risk.**

## Usage 
Requires `python3` with `math`, `sys` and `random`

Start with `python3 app.py`

## Features

Three very basic tools : 

* A password strength tester with (approximative) entropy calculation
* A password generator with customizable strength
* An EFF passphrase generator
